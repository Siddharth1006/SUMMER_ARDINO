# SUMMER_ARDUINO
Summer program Arduino files
In this project, I created a 4-WAY JUNCTION TRAFFIC SIGNAL using an Arduino board. I have used the 12 LED bulbs indicating 4 traaffic signals for 4 directions. The LEDs glow according to 4 situations:

1- Light Traffic(3am to 6am)  2- Medium traffic(6am to 9am) 3- High traffic(9am to 9pm)  4- Light Traffic(AGAIN- 9pm to 3am)

The following input can be given through TINKER CAD simulation and the LED's glow correspondingly as output.

#REQUIREMENTS

a) Online Simulation: Online Simulation Tool('TINKER CAD' in this case)
b) Offline Simulation: Arduino UNO Board , Wires, RBG LED's , BreadBoard , Arduino Software

Note: This is a simple Prototype. The circuit can be improved a lot. Will be glad to accept any changes if you want to contribute in improving it.
